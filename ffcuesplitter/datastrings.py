FFcuesplitter is a multi-platform CUE sheet splitter entirely based on FFmpeg.
Accurately splits big audio tracks and automatically tags them using the
information contained in the associated **"CUE"** sheet. It supports many input
formats (due to FFmpeg), including APE format, and no need installing
third-party libs or packages. It can support multiple CUE sheet encodings via
chardet library. Can be used both as a Python module (API) and in command
line mode.
